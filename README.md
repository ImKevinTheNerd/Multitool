If the Counter Strike, Roblox or Curseforge option doesnt work, then try downloading the games but if you dont play those games, then its fine. 
This is my first Multitool and its coded mainly with Batch but for the shutdown option, the rating system, they are coded in Vbs (Visual basic scripting).
I actually dont know why i added the rating feature if it doesnt give actual feedback online, i dont know if i will learn how to add the online feedback thing anytime but maybe.
